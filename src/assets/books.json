        "description": "Rails is a full-stack, open source web framework that enables you to create full-featured, sophisticated web-based applications, but with a twist... A full Rails application probably has less total code than the XML you'd need to configure the same application in other frameworks. With this book you'll learn how to use \"ActiveRecord\" to connect business objects and database tables. No more painful object-relational mapping. Just create your business objects and let Rails do the rest. You'll learn how to use the \"Action Pack\" framework to route incoming requests and render pages using easy-to-write templates and components. See how to exploit the Rails service frameworks to send emails, implement web services, and create dynamic, user-centric web-pages using built-in Javascript and Ajax support. There are extensive chapters on testing, deployment, and scaling. You'll see how easy it is to install Rails using your web server of choice (such as Apache or lighttpd) or using its own included web server. You'll be writing applications that work with your favorite database (MySQL, Oracle, Postgres, and more) in no time at all. You'll create a complete online store application in the extended tutorial section, so you'll see how a full Rails application is developed---iteratively and rapidly. Rails strives to honor the Pragmatic Programmer's \"DRY Principle\" by avoiding the extra work of configuration files and code annotations. You can develop in real-time: make a change, and watch it work immediately. Forget XML. Everything in Rails, from templates to control flow to business logic, is written in Ruby, the language of choice for programmers who like to get the job done well (and leave work ontime for a change). Rails is the framework of choice for the new generation of Web 2.0 developers. Agile Web Development with Rails is the book for that generation, written by Dave Thomas (Pragmatic Programmer and author of Programming Ruby) and David Heinemeier Hansson, who created Rails.",

        "description": "I bought this book based on the reviews here. It was the highest rated CakePHP book on Amazon at the time so I figured I couldn't go wrong. I was a little wrong about that...\r\rThe book is pretty easy to follow, and it does a good job introducing you to how CakePHP works and talking you through using the MVC pattern. The reason I gave it such a low rating is because of the code typos that litter the pages and all of the terrible, terrible grammar throughout. It's as though the author didn't speak English natively and the editors didn't bother to fix anything! What's worse, some of the concepts in the book are stated exactly backwards; a read headache for the beginner.\r\rIf you already know PHP to some degree and are at least familiar with CakePHP, the book is pretty helpful for solidifying ideas. It's probably one of the better books I've read on the topic in terms of the order in which they teach you and how it's described. But, if you're new to PHP or CakePHP, don't start with this book; you'll be pulling your hair out trying to figure out where the typos in the code are and interpreting the text.\r\rOverall, I'm happy I picked the book up. It's the second one I've been reading and it's helped me make more sense of how some of the components work, but if you're new and you just want to learn how to use CakePHP, you should consider looking elsewhere, or at least reading The Manual on their website first.",

I started reading this book to get introduced to the system, and it was OK for that, but I found I didn't really use it or need it when I actually started making my MODx site. It's a good overview/introduction that may help you understand what MODx is and how it functions, but not totally needed if you just want to jump right in and make a site with MODx. Also, since the release of MODx 1.0/1.0.1, the terminology used in this book is no longer correct, so it may actually confuse you (Resources are now Elements, Documents are now Resources, etc.) And I found some of the writing to be awkward.",

        "author": "Carlos de la Guardia",
        "year": "2010",
        "edition": "2",
        "description": "Grok 1.0 Web Development is a great introduction to what I think is a very powerful web technology stack: the Zope Toolkit.  Grok provides a way for newcomers and those familiar with other Python web stacks to get started with ZTK, which can often seem insular, cryptic, and inaccessible.  When a user is ready to \"move up\", they can start leveraging the power that underlies Grok.  This book is a good introduction to that stack.  \r\rGrok 1.0 Web Development takes what as I think of as a customary approach to framework introductions, instructing the user on the basic features of the framework by building an application (in this case a to do list manager) and adding features and refining the code as it goes. This works well for Grok -- the amount of boilerplate code is kept to a minimum, by design, so the text can focus on first implementing the feature, then delving deeper to discuss the \"best practice\" around that tool if needed. For example, Chapter 6 covers ZODB Catalogs (index). It starts by defining the search view and user interface so that the reader has a functioning search tool to work with, then takes a diversion to discuss how one best structures their application to support search. These detailed drill downs are one of the most valuable parts of Grok 1.0 Web Development: they help the reader expand their understand beyond just implementing a feature, to implementing in a way that will be flexible and easy to support in the future. The [somewhat brief] advice on when to use the ZODB versus a relational database is another example of practical advice that I appreciated in the book.\r\rGrok 1.0 Web Development is not perfect. In particular I wish the chapter on testing were earlier (the author's admonition that it \"should not be treated as an afterthought\" doesn't seem to jibe with its placement among the advanced topics towards the end of the book. I suppose I'm also a little sensitive to slogging on Zope 3 and it's \"lack\" of agility. I can probably be described as a Zope 3 / Zope component architecture apologist, but it seems the type of agility described is a rather narrow, specific definition. The sprints I did on Zope 3 at PyCon several years contributed more to my understanding and appreciation of test driven development and agile planning than just about anything. Yes, Grok gets it done without the ZCML; I think it's an exercise for the reader as to whether that's better or worse for your application.\r\rI think that the Zope derived frameworks such as Grok and repoze.bfg are some of the most interesting in development today. Grok 1.0 Web Development does a great job of introducing Grok to developers who are new to web programming, or who already have some familiarity with another framework. I recommend it to anyone interested in building extensible web applications with a minimum of boilerplate.",

Beginning with coverage of the history of the architecture of Web applications, highlighting the uses of the standard web API to create applications with increasingly sophisticated architectures, developers are led through a discussion on the development of industry accepted best practices for architecture. Described is the history and evolution towards this architecture and the reasons that it is superior to previous efforts. Also provided is an overview of the most popular Web application frameworks, covering their architecture and use. Numerous frameworks exist, but trying to evaluate them is difficult because their documentation stresses their advantages but hides their deficiencies. Here, the same application is built in six different frameworks, providing a way to perform an informed comparison. Also provided is an evaluation of the pros and cons of each framework to assist in making a decision or evaluating a framework on your own. Finally, best practices are covered, including sophisticated user interface techniques, intelligent caching and resource management, performance tuning, debugging, testing, and Web services.",

Moodle is relatively easy to install and use, but the real challenge is to develop a learning process that leverages its power and maps effectively onto the content established learning situation. This book guides you through meeting that challenge.<P>    <P>This unique book gives you more than just a guide to the  Moodle software; it uses Moodle as a route to better teaching, more motivated students, and more successful courses. Moodle is the leading Open Source learning management system. Using Moodle, teachers can easily construct richly textured web based courses.  A course can consist of a number of lessons, with each lesson including reading materials; activities such as quizzes, tests, surveys, and projects; and social elements that encourage interaction and group work between students.Moodle E-Learning Course Development shows you how to use Moodle as a tool to enhance your teaching. It will help you analyse your students' requirements, and come to an understanding of what Moodle can do for them. After that you'll see how to use every feature of Moodle to meet your course goals.<P>    <P>The social constructionist learning philosophy is at the heart of Moodle: we all \"construct\" knowledge through interation with one another and with learning materials in a social way. Moodle E-Learning Course Develelopment will show you how to add static learning material, interactive activities, and social features to your courses so that students reach their learning potential. Whether you want to support traditional class teaching or lecturing, or provide complete online and distance learning courses, this book will prove a powerful resource throughout your use of Moodle.<P>    <P>- Understand what Moodle can do, how it compares to other e-learning packages, and how it can support your teaching strategies   - Install the Moodle software on your own computer or a server, and understand your way around it   - Know how to create different kinds of courses. Moodle can support courses where the group works through the classes with a shared schedule, or where individual students work through at their own pace, or courses where students are free to explore the different topics in their own time. This book will show you how.   - Understand all of Moodle's learning features. Moodle provides features for managing course content, interactive resources, and social activities such as forums and wikis. This book explains what each of these features are, how they work, and most importantly how and when to use them effectively.   - Manage students – so that you can ensure that the right students are going to the right classes; allow students to enrol themselves, or invite students to join a course. You can even set up commercial courses where students pay to sign <P>    <P>William Rice is an experienced trainer and expert on learning and teaching practices. This experience and expertise forms the foundation of his approach: What do we want to teach? How would this best translate into a course? How best can Moodle support these course objectives?Of course, the book contains everything you'd expect from an introduction to Moodle: clear step-by-step instructions, plenty of screenshots, explanations and guides through the many features and options that you have to choose from. Throughout the book, William develops an example course. He uses this example to explore the sort of decisions, design considerations, and thought that goes into developing a successful course.<P>    <P>This book is written for everyone who wants to get the most from Moodle. Beginners to the software will get a thorough guide to how the software works, and some great ideas for getting to a good start with their first course. More experienced Moodlers will find powerful insights into developing more successful and educational courses.<P>",

        "description": "This book was largely a rehash of Spring Web Flow XSD's and Configuration files. The author started by introducing a fairly simple login application with a basic Web Flow. The author skimmed over explaining this basic application. I fully expected the author to continue to build on this example and further explain how to setup and configure a flow and use the power of Spring WebFlow to build a modern JSF based web application. Instead I was presented with page after page of XSD samples and configuration file snippets. The author did a very poor job explaining Web Flow concepts and how all this works together. I will have trouble even using this book as an adequate reference book to augment the online Spring documentation. I definitely would not recommend this book.",

        "description": "Successful web design teams depend on clear communication between developers and their clients—and among members of the development team. Wireframes, site maps, flow charts, and other design diagrams establish a common language so designers and project teams can capture ideas, track progress, and keep their stakeholders informed.    In this all new edition of Communicating Design, author and information architect Dan Brown defines and describes each deliverable, then offers practical advice for creating the documents and using them in the context of teamwork and presentations, independent of methodology. Whatever processes, tools, or approaches you use, this book will help you improve the creation and presentation of your wireframes, site maps, flow charts, and other deliverables.   The book now features:  An improved structure comprising two main sections: Design Diagrams and Design Deliverables. The first focuses on the nuts and bolts of design documentation and the second explains how to pull it all together.  New deliverable: design briefs, as well as updated advice on wireframes, flow charts, and concept models.  More illustrations, to help designers understand the subtle variations and approaches to creating design diagrams. Reader exercises, for those lonely nights when all you really want to do is practice creating wireframes, or for use in workshops and classes. Contributions from industry leaders: Tamara Adlin, Stephen Anderson, Dana Chisnell, Nathan Curtis, Chris Fahey, James Melzer, Steve Mulder, Donna Spencer, and Russ Unger.     “As an educator, I have looked to Communicating Design both as a formal textbook and an informal guide for its design systems that ultimately make our ideas possible and the complex clear.”  —Liz Danzico, from the Foreword  ",
